# <a id="DEVCC">devcc</a>

Developer Crash Course or Carbon Copy (as You like). 

The contents aims at creating understanding 

* WHY developers do some things they do
* HOW these things may done using some tools in a fictitious project

## <a id="0-SETUP-DEVCC">Setup devcc environment</a>

Like developers normally do (or as they normally
[SHOULD do](0-why-vcs/README.md)), we are using a version control tool
to manage our content. Our choice is a tool called `git`, and we store
our content [in a repository](https://github.com/sorsis3/devcc) on
[github](http://github.com) service.


* You need to [install git](0-init-git/README.md) to download
[devcc](https://github.com/sorsis3/devcc) to Your computer. 

* Our fictitious project uses `github`, and and a
[github -account](https://github.com/join) is needed to demonstrate
collaboration.

* You need to be familiar with the command line tool on the operating
system
([Windows](https://www.google.com/search?q=command+line+tool+windows),
[Mac](https://www.google.com/search?q=command+line+tool+mac) or
[Linux](https://www.google.com/search?q=command+line+tool+linux&btnG=Search))
You are using.

* You need to have an editor, which, 
  * allows opening several windows (because implementing some feature
  in a software requires changing)
  * has a syntax highlight support

## <a id="0-MANAGE-DEVELOPMENT">Manage development</a>

We plan to [agile development methodology](0-agile/README.md) to
manage the development.
