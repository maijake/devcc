### Assumptions

In this exercise, we assume that the necessary preliminary work,
e.g. documenting our goal as a
[Concept Paper](http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Concept-Paper), has
been done, and that the funding of the development work is secured.

Throughout the entire project we need to ensure the adequacy of
funding. We must constantly track the amount of work done, and the
amount of work left to create a deliverable product satisfying our
goals.
