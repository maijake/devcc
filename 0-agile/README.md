# <a id="0-agile">Agile Development Methodology</a>

[Core values](http://agilemanifesto.org), and
[the 12 agile principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
were first published in Agile Manifesto year 2001. More background
information on Agile Development Methodology in
[Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).


In short, Agile Software Development can be characterized 

| as                                       | opposed to                       |
| -----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| iterative and incremental development    | waterfall development            |
| collaborative, cross functional teams    | separation of customers and developers |
| working software will be more useful and welcome |  just presenting documents to clients in meetings |
| time-boxed iterations                    | planned, fixed long lasting schedule |
| flexible response to change              | customers and developer agree early on what will be delivered|


Agile Methodologies can be best applied for developmental and
non-sequential projects, especially when developing software
systems. They are *adaptive* by nature, as opposed to
*predictive*. For example, building a house is better managed using
traditional project management techniques.

## Scrum

There are many Agile Methodologies,
[Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29) being
one of the best known. 

Scrum focuses on managing (software) projects. It defines 3 roles with
the following responsibilities:

* **Product Owner**: acts as the voice of the customer, accountable
  that the team delivers value, writes user stories, and manages them
  in **Product Backlog**

* **Development Team**: responsible of delivering potentially
    shippable increments of product at the end of **Sprint**, 3-9
    individuals, cross-functional (analysis, design, develop, test,
    documents, etc.)
	
* **Scrum Master**: facilitator, removes impediments, acts as a buffer
    between the team and any distracting, ensures that Scrum process
    is followed, acts often as the chair in meetings, helps the team
    to improve

Notice: Scrum does not have a project manager, whose responsibilities
of a have been reassigned mainly and mostly to the **Development
Team** and the **Product Owner**.

Artifacts:

* **Product backlog**: prioritized list of (any sort of) requirements,
    (often presented in story format "As *actor of role*, I want
    *what* to, so that *why*"), top of the Product Backlog is
    estimated for business value/Product Owner, and for work
    effort/Team. Work effort is often given using relative size called
    *Story Points*, rounded to Fibonacci numbers (1,2,3,5,8,13, ...),
    or given as T-shirt sizes, etc.

* **Sprint backlog**: list of work team has chosen to implement in Sprint

* **Increment**: all implemented **Product Backlog** -items 

* **Burndown chart**: publicly displayed chart showing remaining
    work in **Sprint Backlog**


![Scrum process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scrum_process.svg "Scrum process")

Scrum process defines following meetings 

* **Sprint planning**: max 8h, at the beginning of iteration, arranged
    in two phases 1) Select the work for next iteration (Sprint), 2)
    Prepare **Sprint Backlog**, which details the time to implement
    the work selected.

* **Daily Scrum**: max 15 min, every day, team, 1) What I have done since
    yesterday, 2) What are the plans for today, 3) any impediments

* **End meeting**: at the end of sprint cycle, arranged in two phases,
    1) present the work done to stakeholders, 2) reflect the previous
    cycle and make continuous process improvements

During sprint Product owner manages product backlog refinement in
process called **Backlog grooming**.
