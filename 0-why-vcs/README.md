## Reasons for using version control systems

Some reasons for using version control systems:

* **undo changes**: its always helpful to go back if a future revision
  of your application doesnâ€™t work as expected after a change
  
* **concurrent file editing**: vcs system help to resolve conflicts,
  when multiple developers need to edit the same file. A conlict may
  be resolved using by **locking** (i.e. vcs allows only one developer
  modify a file at a time) or by **merging** (i.e. vcs detects that a
  conflict has occurred and helps in merging the conflicting
  changes. The merge may **automatic** (if concurrent changes are in
  different part of a file), or **manual** if the vcs -tool needs uses
  support in determining, which change should be used.
  
* **tagging**/**labeling**: the ability to create a snapshot of the
    codebase at any given moment
	
* **collaboration**: multiple developers share their work in a common
    repository, which vcs manages
* support **branching**: enables developers to work parallel in parts
  of software. This may happen e.g., when version is released, and its
  development continues in a separate branch.
