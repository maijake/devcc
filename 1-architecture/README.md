## <a id="CONSTRAINTS-AND-SCOPE">Constraints and Scope</a>

* Constraints
  * Max 8 hours

* Objective
  * To identify non-functional requirements in product backlog
  * Address the [documented concerns](README.md#CONCERNS) 
  * Give on overview 
  
* Scope  
  * Define a feasible development pipeline, which
    * uses state of the art tools
	* is "efficient"
	* can scale up

* Working methods
  * --> use bullet lists (to be transferred into product backlog)
  * --> if required Architecture may documented in more polished manner later
  * Tools
    * markdown
	* [Dia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dia_%28software%29)

## <a id="CONCERNS">Concerns</a>

* <a id="CONCERN-1">CONCERN-1</a>An a professional developer uses the right tools for the right
  job. Installing and managing a large tool set may distract the
  attention from "programming" i.e. from the "real work". How can we
  avoid this in this exercise?
  
* <a id="CONCERN-2">CONCERN-2</a>I would like to get a "big picture"
  of the "developer work", and some pointers, how dig deeper on some
  subject. By the way, what these "subjects", any how (I am not sure
  that I know the before hand)
  
* <a id="CONCERN-3">CONCERN-3</a>Do we have to install, understand and
  use all development pipeline tools? Are all the tools equally
  important? What happens if we encounter problem with some tool, what
  do miss if I do not skip installing some tool?
  
* <a id="CONCERN-4">CONCERN-4</a>We are talking of a "development
  pipeline". Does this mean that the development work goes through
  some kind of steps. What are these steps, and how do they add value
  to the product being developed?
  

## Reference Architecture

[Continuous Delivery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)
[http://www.thoughtworks.com ](http://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-delivery)
[Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912)


![Continuous Delivery Process](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/Continuous_Delivery_process_diagram.png)

 a set of validations through which a piece of software must pass on its way to release.
 
 * aiming at
   * short cycle time trough development pipe lin
 

 * continuous unit testing when developing
 * Compiled artifact repository, where compiled code, reports and metadata are managed
 * Commit , integration to main trunk (as opposed to creating branches, which are merged)
 * tested using several techniques, 
   * developer unit tests
   * quality control tools
   * automated acceptance testing, supported by [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
   
   * potentially releasable
* smoke tests 
* User acceptace test
* Capasity testing

* Increasing confidence as build proceeds through the development pipeline steps
* Environments keep environments as production like
* Fast feedback if errors identified, stop the pipeline
 

## Developer Roles

The following picture shows **Developer Roles** identified in `DevCC` c

![Developer Roles](Roles.png)

**Developer**  is common name for a number more specific roles

* **Analyst** : Role which is further being decomposed to  *Requirements Analyst*, and *Test Analyst*

  * **Requirements Analyst** : Developer analysing requirements, understand the business needs
  
  * **Test Analyst** : Define acceptance criteria for requirements
	
* **Architect** : support as mediator between analysts and implementation developers
  
* **User Interface Developer**: *implementation developer* responsible for user interface functionality

* **User Interface Layout Developer**: *implementation developer*
        responsible for visual aspect of user interface, implement
        also unit tests for the code

* **Backed Developer**: *implementation developer* responsible for
      integrating back end systems and datastores, implement also unit
      tests for the code
  
* **Test Developer**: implement test, which are not unit tests, e.g. acceptance test implementation
  
* **Infrastructure Developer**: Further decomposed to *Development
      Infrastructure Developer* and *Runtime Infrastructure Management
      Developer*

  * **Development Infrastructure Developer**: deliver environment & configuration for *development*

  * **Runtime Infrastructure Management Developer**: deliver environment & configuration for *runtime*

### Architectural Decisions

* Security testing, performance testing not covered here
* User Acceptance testing not covered here

### Concerns addressed

[CONCERN-1](README.md#CONCERN-1), [CONCERN-3](README.md#CONCERN-3):
the tool set has been split up to manageable chunks, *Development
Infrastructure Developer* role is critical in bootstrapping the tool
set, careful risk management needed for activities performed by this
role

[CONCERN-2](README.md#CONCERN-2): roles represent typical development
tasks, technology list acts as a pointer how find out more of the work
these roles do

[CONCERN-4](README.md#CONCERN-4): the roles are active trough various
development phases


## System Architecture

![Systems Architecture](SystemArchitecture.jpg)

Presented in four quadrants

* Local Development Environment 
* Local Runtime Environment 
* Web Development Environment 
* Web Runtime Environment 

Presents the [Methodologies, Technologies, Tools](README.md#METHODOLOGIES-TECHNOLOGIES-TOOLS)

### Architectural Decisions

* Security testing, performance testing not covered here
* User Acceptance testing not covered here

### Concerns addressed

[CONCERN-2](README.md#CONCERN-2): System Architecture shows the big
picture

[CONCERN-3](README.md#CONCERN-3): System Architecture shows maps the
tool to architectural context.

[CONCERN-4](README.md#CONCERN-4): System Architecture shows system
context, where "Development Pipeline" is executed.
