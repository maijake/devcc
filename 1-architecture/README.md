# Devcc Architecture

## Constraints and Scope

* Constraints
  * Max 8 hours

* Objective
  * To identify non-functional requirements in product backlog
  * Address the [documented concerns](#CONCERNS) 
  * Give on overview 
  
* Scope  
  * Define a feasible development pipeline, which
    * uses state of the art tools
	* is "efficient"
	* can scale up

* Working methods
  * --> use bullet lists (to be transferred into product backlog)
  * --> if required Architecture may documented in more polished manner later
  * Tools
    * markdown
	* [Dia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dia_%28software%29)

## Concerns

### CONCERN-1

An a professional developer uses the right tools for the right
job. Installing and managing a large tool set may distract the
attention from "programming" i.e. from the "real work". How can we
avoid this in this exercise?
  
### CONCERN-2

I would like to get a "big picture" of the "developer work", and some
 pointers, how dig deeper on some subject. By the way, what these
 "subjects", any how (I am not sure that I know the before hand)
  
### CONCERN-3

Do we have to install, understand and use all development pipeline
tools? Are all the tools equally important? What happens if we
encounter problem with some tool, what do miss if I do not skip
installing some tool?
  
### CONCERN-4

We are talking of a "development pipeline". Does this mean that the
development work goes through some kind of steps. What are these
steps, and how do they add value to the product being developed?

## Reference Architecture

As reference architecture we are using
[Continuous Delivery](http://www.slideshare.net/jezhumble/continuous-delivery-5359386)
presented in [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912) by
[http://www.thoughtworks.com ](http://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-delivery).

![Continuous Delivery Process](http://www.getchef.com/images/chart-continuous-delivery.png)

Continuous Delivery can be characterized

* on development work bench run continuously unit tests, which provide
  immediate feedback to the developers
* when the delivery checking in their work
*  [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) triggers automatically
   * build 
   * unit tests (=same tests as on the developer workstation)
   * acceptance tests
   * code quality tests 
   * etc
* Also performance and security tests are automated (as far as possible)   
* Automated tests are supported as far possible, how ever some step
  require human work: user acceptance test, presentation to
  stakeholders
* Release should also be managed e.g. "canary releasing" (=small
  deliveries, where problems do not harm the total system),
  "green/blue" (=two parallel systems, which can be easily switched)

Continuous delivery is aiming at
 * short cycle time trough development pipe line, using automated
   tests, continuous integration, small build, smoke tests
 * each commit is potentially deliverable product
 * where the confidence on quality is increased as the build proceeds
   through the development pipeline steps
 * all environments resemble production as much as possible, further
   down to the pipe line environments are even more production like.
 * Commits  to main trunk (as opposed to creating branches, which are merged)
 * Once an artifact gets build/generated (e.g. compiled code,
   binaries, reports, metadata) it is stored in an artifact repository
   (as opposed to keeping the in version control system), allowing
   steps in pipeline to have 100% certainty that they are using
   unmodified artifact

## Developer Roles

The following picture shows **Developer Roles** identified in `DevCC` c

![Developer Roles](Roles.png)

**Developer**  is common name for a number more specific roles

* **Analyst** : Role which is further being decomposed to  *Requirements Analyst*, and *Test Analyst*

  * **Requirements Analyst** : Developer analysing requirements, understand the business needs
  
  * **Test Analyst** : Define acceptance criteria for requirements
	
* **Architect** : support as mediator between analysts and implementation developers
  
* **User Interface Developer**: *implementation developer* responsible for user interface functionality

* **User Interface Layout Developer**: *implementation developer*
        responsible for visual aspect of user interface, implement
        also unit tests for the code

* **Backed Developer**: *implementation developer* responsible for
      integrating back end systems and datastores, implement also unit
      tests for the code
  
* **Test Developer**: implement test, which are not unit tests, e.g. acceptance test implementation
  
* **Infrastructure Developer**: Further decomposed to *Development
      Infrastructure Developer* and *Runtime Infrastructure Management
      Developer*

  * **Development Infrastructure Developer**: deliver environment & configuration for *development*

  * **Runtime Infrastructure Management Developer**: deliver environment & configuration for *runtime*

### Architectural Decisions

* Security testing, performance testing not covered here
* User Acceptance testing not covered here

### Concerns addressed

[CONCERN-1](#CONCERN-1), [CONCERN-3](#CONCERN-3):
the tool set has been split up to manageable chunks, *Development
Infrastructure Developer* role is critical in bootstrapping the tool
set, careful risk management needed for activities performed by this
role

[CONCERN-2](#CONCERN-2): roles represent typical development
tasks, technology list acts as a pointer how find out more of the work
these roles do

[CONCERN-4](#CONCERN-4): the roles are active trough various
development phases


## System Architecture

* Local Runtime Environment

### Architectural Decisions

* Security testing, performance testing not covered here
* User Acceptance testing not covered here

### Concerns addressed

[CONCERN-2](#CONCERN-2): System Architecture shows the big
picture

[CONCERN-3](#CONCERN-3): System Architecture shows maps the
tool to architectural context.

[CONCERN-4](#CONCERN-4): System Architecture shows system
context, where "Development Pipeline" is executed.
